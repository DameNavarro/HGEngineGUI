## üîç Troubleshooting

### Why do I see "No Species Found"?

Common causes:

1. **Wrong Project Path**: Selected wrong folder
2. **Missing Files**: `include/constants/species.h` not found
3. **File Format**: Species definitions malformed
4. **Project Structure**: Not a valid HG Engine project

**Solution**: Verify project structure and file existence.

### Why can't I save changes?

Possible issues:

1. **File Permissions**: No write access to project files
2. **File Locks**: Files open in another program
3. **Disk Space**: Insufficient space for backup files
4. **Antivirus**: Security software blocking file operations

**Solution**: Check permissions, close other programs, and verify disk space.

### Why is the app slow?

Performance issues can be caused by:

1. **Large Projects**: Many species/trainers to load
2. **Slow Storage**: Network drives or slow disks
3. **Memory**: Insufficient RAM for large datasets
4. **Background Processes**: System resource contention

**Solution**: Use local SSD storage and close unnecessary applications.

### How do I report bugs?

To report bugs effectively:

1. **Gather Information**:
   - Windows version and HG Engine Editor version
   - Exact steps to reproduce the issue
   - Error messages and crash logs

2. **Check Existing Issues**: Search GitHub issues first
